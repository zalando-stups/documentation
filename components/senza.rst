Senza
=====

**Senza** is STUPS' deployment tool to create and execute `AWS CloudFormation templates`_ in a sane way.

See the :ref:`deployment` section for details on how to deploy applications using Senza, :ref:`pierone` and :ref:`taupage`.

Installation
============

Install or upgrade to the latest version of Senza (|senza-pypi-version|) with PIP:

.. |senza-pypi-version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/stups-senza.svg
   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stups-senza/
   :alt: Latest PyPI version

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip3 install --upgrade stups-senza


Command Line Usage
==================

Senza definitions can be bootstrapped conveniently to get started quickly:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza init myapp.yaml

Cloud Formation stacks are created from Senza definitions with the ``create`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza create myapp.yaml 1 0.1-SNAPSHOT

You can disable the automatic Cloud Formation rollback-on-failure in order to do 'post-mortem' debugging (e.g. on an EC2 instance):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza create --disable-rollback myerroneous-stack.yaml 1 0.1-SNAPSHOT

You can pass parameters from yaml file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza create --parameter-file parameters.yaml myapp.yaml 1 0.1-SNAPSHOT


Stacks can be listed using the ``list`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza list myapp.yaml         # list only active stacks for myapp
    $ senza list myapp.yaml --all   # list stacks for myapp (also deleted ones)
    $ senza list                    # list all active stacks
    $ senza list --all              # list all stacks (including deleted ones)
    $ senza list "suite-.*" 1       # list stacks starting with "suite" and with version "1"
    $ senza list ".*" 42            # list all stacks  with version "42"
    $ senza list mystack ".*test"  # list all stacks for "mystack" with version ending in "test"

There are a few commands to get more detailed information about stacks:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza resources myapp.yaml 1 # list all CF resources
    $ senza events myapp.yaml 1    # list all CF events
    $ senza instances myapp.yaml 1 # list EC2 instances and IPs
    $ senza console myapp.yaml 1   # get EC2 console output for all stack instances
    $ senza console 172.31.1.2     # get EC2 console output for single instance

Most commands take so-called `STACK_REF` arguments, you can either use an
existing Senza definition YAML file (as shown above) or use the stack's name
and version, you can also use regular expressions to match multiple
applications and versions:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza inst                    # all instances, no STACK_REF argument given
    $ senza inst mystack            # list instances for all versions of "mystack"
    $ senza inst mystack 1          # only list instances for "mystack" version "1"
    $ senza inst "suite-.*" 1       # list instances starting with "suite" and with version "1"
    $ senza inst ".*" 42            # list all instances  with version "42"
    $ senza inst mystack ".*test"  # list all instances for "mystack" with version ending in "test"

Traffic can be routed via Route53 DNS to your new stack:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza traffic myapp.yaml      # show traffic distribution
    $ senza traffic myapp.yaml 2 50 # give version 2 50% of traffic

.. WARNING::
   Some clients use connection pools which - by default - reuse connections as long as there are requests to be processed. In this case ``senza traffic`` won't result in any redirection of the traffic, unfortunately. To force such clients to switch traffic from one stack to the other you might want to manually disable the load balancer (ELB) of the old stack, e.g. by changing the ELB listener port. This switches traffic entirely. Switching traffic slowly (via weighted DNS records) is only possible for NEW connections.

   It is recommended to monitor the behavior of clients during traffic switching and if necessary to ask them to reconfigure their connection pools.

Stacks can be deleted when they are no longer used:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza delete myapp.yaml 1
    $ senza del mystack          # shortcut: delete the only version of "mystack"

Available Taupage AMIs and all other used AMIs can be listed to check whether old, outdated images are still in-use or if a new Taupage AMI is available:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza images


.. Tip::

    All commands and subcommands can be abbreviated, i.e. the following lines are equivalent:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ senza list
        $ senza l

Bash Completion
---------------

The programmable completion feature in Bash permits typing a partial command, then pressing the :kbd:`[Tab]` key to autocomplete the command sequence.
If multiple completions are possible, then :kbd:`[Tab]` lists them all.

To activate bash completion for the Senza CLI, just run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ eval "$(_SENZA_COMPLETE=source senza)"

Put the eval line into your :file:`.bashrc`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo 'eval "$(_SENZA_COMPLETE=source senza)"' >> ~/.bashrc


Controlling Command Output
--------------------------

The Senza CLI supports three different output formats:

``text``
    Default ANSI-colored output for human users.
``json``
    JSON output of tables for scripting.
``tsv``
    Print tables as `tab-separated values (TSV)`_.

JSON is best for handling the output programmatically via various languages or `jq`_ (a command-line JSON processor). The text format is easy for humans to read, and "tsv" format works well with traditional Unix text processing tools, such as sed, grep, and awk:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza list --output json | jq .
    $ senza instances my-stack --output tsv | awk -F\\t '{ print $6 }'

.. _senza-definition:

Senza Definition
================

Senza definitions are Cloud Formation templates as YAML with added 'components' on top.
A minimal Senza definition without any Senza components would look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

    Description: "A minimal Cloud Formation stack creating a SQS queue"
    SenzaInfo:
      StackName: example
    Resources:
      MyQueue:
        Type: AWS::SQS::Queue

.. Tip::

    Use ``senza init`` to quickly bootstrap a new Senza definition YAML for most common use cases (e.g. a web application).

During evaluation of the definition, mustache templating is applied with access to the rendered definition,
including the SenzaInfo, SenzaComponents and Arguments key (containing all given arguments).

Senza Info
----------

The ``SenzaInfo`` key must always be present in the definition YAML and configures global Senza behavior.

Available properties for the ``SenzaInfo`` section are:

``StackName``
    The stack name (required).
``OperatorTopicId``
    Optional SNS topic name or ARN for Cloud Formation notifications. This can used for example to send notifications about deployments to a mailing list.
``Parameters``
    Custom Senza definition parameters. This can be used to dynamically substitute variables in the Cloud Formation template.
``SpotinstAccessToken``
    The access token required to create Elastigroups (optional). See the `Senza::Elastigroup`_ component
    for more details.
    This property can be encrypted with KMS. It will be decrypted by the senza client to generate the
    Cloud Formation template.
    The expected format is: "senza:kms:AQICAH...r0lbg==" where "senza:kms:" is the chosen prefix and the
    remainder is the encrypted secret.

.. Tip:: Follow the vendor's instructions to `Create an API token`_.

``SpotinstAccountId``
    Optional property that contains the target Spotinst account Id. For ex. ``act-123c12d3``
    Senza will try to discover the target Spotinst account by looking up the one associated with the AWS account
    where the CloudFormation stack is being created.
    You can lookup the Spotinst account Id using the `Spotinst console`_.  

.. WARNING:: Spotinst account discovery is only possible with personal tokens. When using programmatic user tokens this property **MUST** be present or the deployment will fail.

.. Note:: By default any HTML entities within a parameter will be escaped, this may cause some unexpected behaviour. In the event you need to workaround this use three braces either side of your argument evaluation e.g. ``{{{Arguments.ApplicationId}}}``

.. code-block:: yaml

    # basic information for generating and executing this definition
    SenzaInfo:
      StackName: hello-world
      Parameters:
        - ApplicationId:
            Description: "Application ID from kio"
        - ImageVersion:
            Description: "Docker image version of hello-world."
        - MintBucket:
            Description: "Mint bucket for your team"
        - GreetingText:
            Description: "The greeting to be displayed"
            Default: "Hello, world!"
            MinLength: "1"
            MaxLength: "16"
    # a list of senza components to apply to the definition
    SenzaComponents:
      # this basic configuration is required for the other components
      - Configuration:
          Type: Senza::StupsAutoConfiguration # auto-detect network setup
      # will create a launch configuration and auto scaling group with scaling triggers
      - AppServer:
          Type: Senza::TaupageAutoScalingGroup
          InstanceType: t2.micro
          SecurityGroups:
            - app-{{Arguments.ApplicationId}}
          IamRoles:
            - app-{{Arguments.ApplicationId}}
          AssociatePublicIpAddress: false # change for standalone deployment in default VPC
          TaupageConfig:
            application_version: "{{Arguments.ImageVersion}}"
            runtime: Docker
            source: "stups/hello-world:{{Arguments.ImageVersion}}"
            mint_bucket: "{{Arguments.MintBucket}}"

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza create example.yaml 3
    Usage: __main__.py create [OPTIONS] DEFINITION VERSION [PARAMETER]...

    Error: Missing parameter "ApplicationId"
    $ senza create example.yaml 3 example latest mint-bucket
    Generating Cloud Formation template.. OK
    Creating Cloud Formation stack hello-world-3.. OK

The parameters can also be specified by name, which might come handy in
complex scenarios with sizeable number of parameters, and also to make the
command line more easily readable, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza create example.yaml 3 example MintBucket=<mint-bucket> ImageVersion=latest

Here, the ``ApplicationId`` is given as a positional parameter, then the two
other parameters follow specified by their names.  The named parameters on the
command line can be given in any order, but no positional parameter is allowed
to follow the named ones.

.. Note::

   The ``name=value`` named parameters are split on first ``=`` which makes it
   possible to still include a literal ``=`` in the value part.  This also
   means that if you have to include it in the parameter value, you need to
   pass this parameter with the name, to prevent ``senza`` from treating the
   part of the parameter value before the first ``=`` as the parameter name.

It is possible to pass any of the supported `CloudFormation Properties <http://
docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/
parameters-section-structure.html>`_ such as ``AllowedPattern``, ``AllowedValues``,
``MinLength``, ``MaxLength`` and many others. Senza itself will not enforce these
but CloudFormation will evaluate the generated template and raise an exception
if any of the Properties is not met. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza create example.yaml 3 example latest mint-bucket "Way too long greeting"
    Generating Cloud Formation template.. OK
    Creating Cloud Formation stack hello-world-3.. EXCEPTION OCCURRED: An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateStack operation: Parameter 'GreetingText' must contain at most 15 characters
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    [...]

Any parameter may be given a default value using ``Default`` attribute.
If a parameter was not specified on the command line (either as positional or
named one), the default value is used.  It makes sense to always put all
parameters which have a default value at the bottom of the parameter
definition list, otherwise one will be forced to specify all the following
parameters using a ``name=value`` as there would be no way to map them to
proper position.

There is an option to pass parameters from file. The file needs to be formatted in yaml.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza create --parameter-file parameters.yaml example.yaml 3 1.0-SNAPSHOT

Here is an example of a parameter file.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ApplicationId: example-app-id
   MintBucket: your-mint-bucket

You can also combine parameter file and parameters from command line, but you can't have same parameter twice. The parameter can't exist both on file and command line.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ senza create --parameter-file parameters.yaml example.yaml 3 1.0-SNAPSHOT Param=Example1

AccountInfo
-----------

The following properties are also available in Senza templates.

``{{AccountInfo.Region}}`` : the AWS region where the stack is created. Ex: 'eu-central-1'.
Note: in many places of a template, `{"Ref" : "AWS::Region"}` can also be used.

``{{AccountInfo.AccountAlias}}`` : the alias name of the AWS account: ex: 'super-team1-account'

``{{AccountInfo.AccountID}}`` : the AWS account id: ex: '353272323354'

``{{AccountInfo.TeamID}}`` : the team ID. Ex: 'super-team1'.

``{{AccountInfo.Domain}}`` : the AWS account domain: Ex: super-team1.net

Mappings
--------

Mappings are essentially key-value pairs and behave exactly as `CloudFormation Mappings <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/mappings-section-structure.html>`_. Use Mappings for ``Images``, ``ServerSubnets`` or ``LoadBalancerSubnets``. An Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   Mappings:
      Images:
         eu-west-1:
            MyImage: "ami-123123"
   # (..)
   Image: MyImage

Senza Components
----------------

Components are predefined Cloud Formation snippets that are easy to configure and generate all the boilerplate JSON that is required by Cloud Formation.

All Senza components must be configured in a list below the top-level "SenzaComponents" key, the structure is as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    SenzaComponents:
      - ComponentName1:
          Type: ComponentType1
          SomeComponentProperty: "some value"
      - ComponentName2:
          Type: ComponentType2

.. Note::

    Please note that each list item below "SenzaComponents" is a map with only one key (the component name).
    The YAML "flow-style" syntax would be: ``SenzaComponents: [{CompName: {Type: CompType}}]``.


Senza::StupsAutoConfiguration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **StupsAutoConfiguration** component type autodetects load balancer and server subnets by relying on STUPS' naming convention (DMZ subnets have "dmz" in their name). It also finds the latest Taupage AMIs and defines the images which can be used by the "TaupageAutoScalingGroup" component.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: yaml

    SenzaComponents:
      - Configuration:
          Type: Senza::StupsAutoConfiguration

This component supports the following configuration properties:

``AvailabilityZones``
    Optional list of AZ names (e.g. "eu-west-1a") to filter subnets by.
    This option is relevant for attaching EBS volumes as they are bound to availability zones.

This components adds the following images:

``LatestTaupageImage``
    Latest Taupage AMI, for use in production deployments. Selected by default in the "TaupageAutoScalingGroup" component.

``LatestTaupageStagingImage``
    Staging Taupage AMI, for testing compatibility with the new Taupage releases. Should not be used for production deployments!

``LatestTaupageDevImage``
    Latest build of the Taupage AMI. Should not be used unless you're working on Taupage or its components.

.. _senza-taupage-auto-scaling-group:

Senza::TaupageAutoScalingGroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **TaupageAutoScalingGroup** component type creates one AWS AutoScalingGroup resource with a LaunchConfiguration for the Taupage AMI.

.. code-block:: yaml

    SenzaComponents:
      - AppServer:
          Type: Senza::TaupageAutoScalingGroup
          InstanceType: t2.micro
          SecurityGroups:
            - app-myapp
          ElasticLoadBalancer: AppLoadBalancer
          TaupageConfig:
            runtime: Docker
            source: pierone.example.org/foobar/myapp:1.0
            ports:
              8080: 8080
            environment:
              FOO: bar

This component supports the following configuration properties:

``InstanceType``
    The EC2 instance type to use.
``SpotPrice``
    Maximum amount of US dollars you want to spent per hour for
    a given instance type. See :ref:`spot-price`.
``SecurityGroups``
    List of security groups to associate the EC2 instances with. Each list item can be either an existing security group name or ID.
``IamInstanceProfile``
    ARN of the IAM instance profile to use. You can either use "IamInstanceProfile" or "IamRoles", but not both.
``IamRoles``
    List of IAM role names to use for the automatically created instance profile.
``Image``
    AMI to use, defaults to ``LatestTaupageImage``. If you want to use a different AMI, you have to create a Mapping for it.
``ElasticLoadBalancer``
    Name of the ELB resource. Specifying the ELB resource will automatically use the `"ELB" health check type for the auto scaling group`_.
    This property also allows attaching multiple load balancers to the Auto Scaling Group by using a list instead of string, e.g. ``ElasticLoadBalancer: [LB1, LB2]``.
``HealthCheckType``
    How the auto scaling group should perform instance health checks. Value can be either "EC2" or "ELB".
    Default is "ELB" if ``ElasticLoadBalancer`` is set and "EC2" otherwise.
``HealthCheckGracePeriod``
    The length of time in seconds after a new EC2 instance comes into service that Auto Scaling starts checking its health.
``TaupageConfig``
    Taupage AMI config, see :ref:`taupage` for details.
    At least the properties ``runtime`` ("Docker") and ``source`` (Docker image) are required.
    Usually you will want to specify ``ports`` and ``environment`` too.
``AssociatePublicIpAddress``
    Whether to associate EC2 instances with a public IP address. This boolean value (true/false) is false by default.
``BlockDeviceMappings``
    Specify additional EBS Devices you want to attach to the nodes. See for Option Map below.
``AutoScaling``
    Map of auto scaling properties, see below.

**AutoScaling**

``AutoScaling`` properties are:

``Minimum``
    Minimum number of instances to spawn.
``Maximum``
    Maximum number of instances to spawn.
``DesiredCapacity``
    Desired number of instances to spawn.
``SuccessRequires``
    During startup of the stack, define when your ASG is considered healthy by CloudFormation. Defaults to one healthy instance within 15 minutes. To change it to 4 healthy instances within 1 hour, 20 minutes and 30 seconds pass "4 within 1h20m30s" (you can omit hours/minutes/seconds as you please). Values that look like integers will be used as healthy instance count, e.g. "2" would be interpreted as 2 healthy instances within the default timeout of 15 minutes.
``MetricType``
    Metric to do auto scaling on. This will create automatic Alarms in Cloudwatch for you. If supplied, must be either ``CPU``, ``NetworkIn`` or ``NetworkOut``. If not supplied, you're Auto Scaling Group will not dynamically scale and you have to define you're own alerts.
``ScaleUpThreshold``
    On which value of the metric to scale up. For the "CPU" metric: a value of 70 would mean 70% CPU usage. For network metrics a value of 100 would mean 100 bytes, but you can pass the unit (KB/GB/TB), e.g. "100 GB".
``ScaleDownThreshold``
    On which value of the metric to scale down. For the "CPU" metric: a value of 40 would mean 40% CPU usage. For network metrics a value of 2 would mean 2 bytes, but you can pass the unit (KB/GB/TB), e.g. "2 GB".
``ScalingAdjustment``
    How many instances are added/removed per scaling action. Defaults to 1.
``Cooldown``:
    After a scaling action occured, do not scale again for this amount of time in seconds. Defaults to 60 (one minute).
``Statistic``
    Which statistic to track in order to decide when scaling thresholds are met. Defaults to "Average", can also be "SampleCount", "Sum", "Minimum", "Maximum".
``Period``
    Period over which statistic is calculated (in seconds), defaults to 300 (five minutes). It can be 10, 30 or multiples of 60 seconds.
``EvaluationPeriods``
    The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. Defaults to 2.

**BlockDeviceMappings**

``BlockDeviceMappings`` properties are:

``DeviceName``
    For example: /dev/xvdk
``Ebs``
    Map of EBS Options, see below.


``Ebs`` properties are:

``VolumeSize``
    How Much GB should this EBS have?


.. _spot-price:

Spot Instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To save money you can choose to use `AWS spot instance`_, instead of
using on demand instances. To choose the right instance type and pay
up to the current price of an on demand instance you can search `AWS
instance prices`_ list. This block will buy a c4.large instance for up
to $0.134 per hour.

.. code-block:: yaml

    SenzaComponents:
      - AppServer:
          Type: Senza::TaupageAutoScalingGroup
          InstanceType: c4.large
          SpotPrice: 0.134

Senza also supports `Spotinst's`_ `Elastigroup`_. For details how that works with
senza read the section `Senza::Elastigroup`_

Senza::Elastigroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Elastrigoup** component type creates an Elastigroup. It's the equivalent of
an Auto Scaling Group, but managed externally by a third party - Spotinst.

.. Tip::

   To be able to use Elastigroups you need to specify the ``SpotinstAccessToken`` 
   property from the `Senza Info`_ section.

Quote from the vendor: "Spotinst Elastigroup predicts EC2 Spot behavior, capacity
trends, pricing, and interruptions rate. Whenever there’s a risk of interruption,
Elastigroup acts accordingly to balance capacity up to 15 minutes ahead of time,
ensuring 100% availability."

.. code-block:: yaml

    SenzaComponents:
      - AppServer:
          Type: Senza::Elastigroup
          InstanceType: "c5.large"
          SpotAlternatives:
              - "m5.large"
              - "c5.xlarge"
          SecurityGroups: app-hello-world
          IamRoles:
            - app-hello-world
          ElasticLoadBalancerV2: AppLoadBalancer
          TaupageConfig:
            runtime: Docker
            source: pierone.example.org/foobar/myapp:1.0
            ports:
              8080: 8080
            environment:
              FOO: bar

This component accepts ALL of the properties of the `Senza::TaupageAutoScalingGroup`_
component. They are mapped to the corresponding attributes of the Elastigroup.
This includes the ``AutoScaling`` properties.

It adds the following additional properties:

``SpotAlternatives``
    The EC2 instance types that should be used as Spot instead of the On-Demand
    ``InstanceType``. The selection of which ones are effectivelly used is controlled
    by the `Elastigroup cluster orientation`_. The default setting is "Balanced".
    If this property is not set, the same instance type as the On-Demand ``InstanceType``
    is set as the single Spot alternative.

.. Note::

    If this property is set, the instance type specified in ``InstanceType``
    will not be considered for the Spot alternatives. This is by design, in order to allow
    users to specify a type on instance different from the ones used for Spot. To allow
    the same instance type in Spot or On-Demand that type will have to be present in both
    properties.

``Elastigroup``
    This is the, optional, raw specification of the Elastigroup. Please refer to the 
    vendor documentation for the full specification of the `Elastigroup Create API`_.
    The content of this property is copied to the ``group`` attribute of the API.
    Please read below for details about precedence of conflicting settings.

Senza will try to mix and match `Senza::TaupageAutoScalingGroup`_ properties with the
Elastigroup. Raw definitions inside the ``Elastigroup`` property take precedence
and will be left untouched. For example, if the Senza file contains:

.. code-block:: yaml

    SenzaComponents:
      - AppServer:
          Type: Senza::Elastigroup
          InstanceType: "c5.large"
          SpotAlternatives:
              - "m5.large"
              - "c5.xlarge"
          Elastigroup:
              compute:
                  instanceTypes:
                      ondemand: "m4.large"
                      spot:
                          - "m4.xlarge"
                          - "m4.2xlarge"

The effective setting will be to use **m4.large** as On-Demand and **m4.xlarge** and
**m4.2xlarge** as the spot alternatives. The ``InstanceType`` and ``SpotAlternatives``
properties are ignored.

This is the behavior of all the remaining properties that can be also set in the
``Elastigroup`` property.

Senza::WeightedDnsElasticLoadBalancer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **WeightedDnsElasticLoadBalancer** component type creates one HTTPs ELB resource with Route 53 weighted domains.
The SSL certificate name used by the ELB can either be given (``SSLCertificateId``) or is autodetected.
You can specify the main domain (``MainDomain``) or the default Route53 hosted zone is used for the domain name.
By default, an internal load balancer is created. This is different from the AWS default behaviour. To create an internet-facing
ELB, explicitly set the ``Scheme`` to ``internet-facing``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    SenzaComponents:
      - AppLoadBalancer:
          Type: Senza::WeightedDnsElasticLoadBalancer
          HTTPPort: 8080
          SecurityGroups:
            - app-myapp-lb

The WeightedDnsElasticLoadBalancer component supports the following configuration properties:

``HTTPPort``
    The HTTP port used by the EC2 instances.
``HealthCheckPath``
    HTTP path to use for health check (must return 200), e.g. "/health"
``HealthCheckPort``
    Optional. Port used for the health check. Defaults to ``HTTPPort``.
``SecurityGroups``
    List of security groups to use for the ELB. The security groups must allow SSL traffic.
``MainDomain``
    Main domain to use, e.g. "myapp.example.org"
``VersionDomain``
    Version domain to use, e.g. "myapp-1.example.org". You can use the usual templating feature to integrate the stack version, e.g.
    ``myapp-{{SenzaInfo.StackVersion}}.example.org``.
``Scheme``
    The load balancer scheme. Either ``internal`` or ``internet-facing``. Defaults to ``internal``.
``SSLCertificateId``
    Name or ARN ID of the uploaded SSL/TLS server certificate to use, e.g. ``myapp-example-org-letsencrypt`` or ``arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123123123:certificate/abcdefgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst-uvwxyz012345``.
    You can check available IAM server certificates with :code:`aws iam list-server-certificates`. For ACM Certificate you must use :code:`aws acm list-certificates`

Additionally, you can specify any of the `valid AWS Cloud Formation ELB properties`_ (e.g. to overwrite ``Listeners``).

Cross-Stack References
======================

Traditional CloudFormation templates only allow to reference resouces that are located in the same template. This can be
quite limiting. To compensate Senza selectively supports special *cross-stack references* in some places in your template, e.g. in `SecurityGroups` and `IamRoles`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   AppServer:
      Type: Senza::TaupageAutoScalingGroup
      InstanceType: c4.xlarge
      SecurityGroups:
        - Stack: base-1
          LogicalId: ApplicationSecurityGroup
      IamRoles:
        - Stack: base-1
          LogicalId: ApplicationRole

These references allow for having an additional special stack per application that defines common security groups and IAM roles that are shared across different versions (in contrast to using `senza init`).

Another use case for cross-stack references if one needs to access outputs from other stacks inside the `TaupageConfig`:


.. code-block:: yaml

   # database.yaml
   ..
   Outputs:
     DatabaseHost:
       Value:
         "Fn::GetAtt": [Database, Endpoint.Address]

   # service.yaml
   ..
   TaupageConfig:
     environment:
       DB_HOST:
         Stack: exchange-rate-database-2
         Output: DatabaseHost
